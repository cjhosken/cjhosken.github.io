# Introduction

Fallout shopping was a short project I did over the summer about a retail robot that goes shopping in a post-apocalyptic world. The idea for this came when I was at a shopping mall and saw a retail bot trying to leave a store. I was able to submit the short to the TACGA 2022 Beyond Animation Film Festival in Bangkok, Thailand. 

## Concept

I based my environment off two shopping malls in my home city.

Once I had the environment done I made a quick storyboard.

## The Retail Robot

The Retail Robot was relatively simple to make, I found rigging the eyes to be a fun technical challenge.

## Lighting & Rendering

I rendered the project on my home computer, and then edited and published it.

## TACGA (Thai Animation And Computer Graphics Association) Beyond Animation Festival

About a month after I finished *Fallout Shopping*, I heard there was an Animation Film Festival in Bangkok, Thailand. I submitted my short and it was accepted into the showcase.
