# Overview

For my Programming Principles class at Bournemouth University, we had to write a C++/SDL2 application. I chose to make an MSPaint-like program. You can see the manual and report below.

I found that using an old paint software like this extremely frustrating to use. Hence the name, ***PAIN***ter.
