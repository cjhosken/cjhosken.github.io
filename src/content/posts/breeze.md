## Overview

Breeze Render Engine is a C++ application that allows artists to create scenes in OpenGL and then render them out with Breeze's custom render engine.

Built off the Ray Tracing in One Weekend tutorial series, Breeze Render Engine was written with C++, OpenGL, and Qt.

A screenshot of a scene made in Breeze. You can download and try the application from https://github.com/cjhosken/breeze_render_engine. 

## Usage

A screenshot of the viewport in use. I wanted to especially focus on the professional look of the application and tried to make it as minimal as possible.

The application could also read in .obj files for rendering.

## Tutorial

A brief tutorial was made showing the application in action.
