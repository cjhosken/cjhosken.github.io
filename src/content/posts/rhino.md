## Introduction

Rhino FX was an exploriation into the MPM tools in Houdini, as well as how to build environments using Houdini Solaris. I used Quixel assets for the envionment, and found an animation of a Rhino online. The FX was done by me in Houdini.

## Breakdown

A viewport animation of the environment. Mostly made up of Quixel Megascans, I re-purposed an old USD Quixel asset generator to quickly make instancable USD assets. The trees were made using Houdini's tree generation tools. I had enough variants to populate the scene without repetition.
