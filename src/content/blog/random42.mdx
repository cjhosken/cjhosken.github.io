# Introduction
One of our units at Bournemouth University involved us being given a task by Industry Professionals. 
I decided to choose the Random42 brief as a chance to work as a generalist, as well as dive back into Blender.

# Brief
The brief was simple; given a clip of audio, make a medical visualization of the Hepatitis B virus travelling through the body and attaching to the liver. 
We were given free reign to use whatever software we liked, and we had 3 months to complete the project.

# Pre-Production

## Initial Research
I wanted my animation to invoke the same sort of feeling one would get looking at sci-fi cinematics, so I began by researching into a few artists who I could take inspiration from.

I also wanted my project to feel scientifcally accurate, so I also researched the virus itself, as well as the parts of the body it would interact with.


Once I was complete with my research, I jumped into Blender to create my animatic.

## Animatic

For my animatic, I blocked everything out using very basic shapes.

  </video>
</div>

I also quickly made some "thumbails" to help convey the mood I wanted for the film.

</div>

I then showed the animatic and thumbnails to Random42.

# Production
Once everyone was happy with the animatic, I moved onto the polishing the shots.

## The Virus
For the Virus, I took some medical data and remeshed it into a blobby shape. I then designed a shader in Blender to make it feel hostile and alive.

## Lighting
For lighting I used alot of atmospherics and fog. I enjoyed everything being rim lit.

## ACES Pipeline
Colorspace has always been a confusing subject, and with the newly released Blender 5.0 (with ACES), 
I decided it would be the perfect project to try and properly understand what was going on.
I was able to pass through the correct color from Blender, to Nuke, all the way into Resolve, which was extremely satisfying to see.

## Compositing
Alot of the extra detail in the animatic came from the compositing side. 
I didn't want to try and manually render dust or any other effects (due to time constraints), so those were added inside of Nuke.

## Editing
I had a working edit file from when the animatic was made, and I would consistently update it through production as shots were updated.
I would take the composited shots, edit the color, and then add some graphics on top.

I also took the original voice lines and fed them into ElevenLabs, an AI tool that creates professional voice over audio from text.

# Conclusion

Overall I was satisfied with the project. Given more time I would have loved to refine some of the lighting and motion of the shots, as well as add some simulated elements within Houdini.
