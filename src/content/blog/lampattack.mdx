# Introduction

I was having lunch one day after recently watching a Pixar film, and I wondered *"Why does Luxo Jr jump on the letter I?"*. This second me into a creative spiral in which I came up with the idea for Lamp Attack! - A War Of the Worlds style short about the Pixar lamps and Pixar letters.

## Pre-Production
My first concept was a drawing of a city street with lamps running all over the place and a giant Pixar lamp looming over them.

From there, I began working on an animatic. I then used this animatic to help build a team of artists (Mostly those who worked on [Sparky](/blog/sparky)).

## Modelling & Rigging
Once I got a team, we began working on the assets. I was responsible for all the characters, while others worked on the environment.

I didn't find any resources on how to nicely create and rig a Pixar letter, so I made my own tutorial series.

## Animation

Once the assets were created, I began animating. I used the Pixar intro as my main source of reference. This was one of my early animation tests.

After the animation was complete, I worked on getting the crown simulation to work. I used a combination of particle physics and boids in Blender for crowd simulation. Below is an example of one my failed tests in which the letters start jumping around.

## Rendering
It took us about 2 months to render the entire shot. I used [SheepIT Renderfarm](https://www.sheepit-renderfarm.com/home) for rendering and had to get in contact with the developers as the project broke the renderfarm. The team were extremely helpful and were able to get the shot to finish rendering. After rendering, we edited the short and then premiered it on Youtube.


### Alternative Pixar Intro
In my spare time I was able to through together an alternative Pixar intro.
