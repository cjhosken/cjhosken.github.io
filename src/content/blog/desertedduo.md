# Introduction

Deserted Duo was a game that my friends and I made in Unity for the 2024 BFX Game Jam. We had 72 hours to create whatever we wanted around the theme: connections.

We came up with the idea of all your controls being blocks in the world that you can pick up and drop down. You need to "connect" the blocks together so that you can navigate the map.

We found this teamwork game alot of fun to make, and even more fun to play!

## 2024 BFX Festival

We came first overall out of 18 teams, and also won:

 - Best 3D Art
 - Best Mechanics
