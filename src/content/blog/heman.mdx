## Modelling

As part of our Modelling and Texturing Assignment at Bournemouth University, we were tasked with making a stylized hero asset based on a given concept. I decided to choose the Heman concept by Michael McCabe.

We began by blocking out our character in ZBrush; starting the basic shapes, then the muscles, then the finer details. The hardsurface assets were then modeled in Maya.

## Rigging

The rig was created from scratch in Maya. I hadn't done FK/IK switching before and wanted to give that a go.

## Houdini & Lookdev
The asset was then textured in Substance Painter and brought into Houdini for groom. Heman was rendered in a custom Houdini Lookdev environment that I designed.

## USD Pipeline

Continuing on from the [Jupiter Steam Train](/blog/jupiter) I built Heman as a USD asset. This is following a new USD Pipeline workflow that I have developed for future projects.

The pipeline worked extremely well for completing a full rounded-character.
