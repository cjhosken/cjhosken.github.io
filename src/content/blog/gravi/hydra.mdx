# Hydra Render Delegates

## Introduction

Pixar's USD (Universal Scene Description) is starting to become a popular choice in the VFX and Animation industry. Not only does is support numerous DCC's,

I am one of those who absolutely open-source projects and have jumped on learning how to use USD in my own animations. More recently I have been exploring USD from a developer's standpoint; 
Looking at how to write renderers and procedurals, and custom USD data. 

This article is a quick explaination of the things I have learn't whilst creating Gravi, a non-linear Hydra render delegate.

## Debugging & Other Information

As of 2025, there's not much information about how to develop USD renderers. Luckily, there are plenty of open source projects that can be used for guidance. I strongly recommend having a look at the OpenUSD source code.

For debugging, setting the `TF_DEBUG` environment variable can display a log of what Hydra (and USD) are doing. I found that when things get tough I set `TF_DEBUG=HD*`, which will log every Hydra command.
