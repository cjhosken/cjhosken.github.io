Being a student film, we sadly did not have the budget as a team to buy a £900 light probe kit. 

We instead went for the low budget £60 alternative (£15 per person, 4 balls).

## Light Probe Requirements

The two most important factors for creating accurate light probes are:

1. Accurate, clean reflections

2. 18% reflective matte grey surface

This is best shown on a sphere because:

1. A reflective sphere mimics a fisheye lens, giving you a similar reference to an HDRI.

2. A sphere allows you to see bounce light from *all* directions. Giving you an easy to read reference.

3. Spheres are dead-easy to replicate in CG, making lightmatching simpler.

## Prepping the parts

### The Chrome Sphere

It's extremely diffucult (and costly) to obtain perfectly smooth and reflective spheres. 
We ended up spending £20 on 4 Garden Chrome balls from Amazon.

        We then had 4 spheres, a 20cm, 15cm, and 10cm (x2). They were heavier than expected and felt like good quality.

        However, the spheres had a seam running around the edge that would warp reflections (However this was barely noticable in our light captures)

### The 18% Grey & More

        Originally, our plan was to go to the nearest hardware store and find any gray paint that had a similar 18% reflectance. 
        But then we found a can of perfectly 18% grey spray paint on [VFX Store](vfx-store.com) for £20. We decided *"why not?"* and went for it.

        One issue that we had with making our own probes was that we didn't have anything to connect it to. 
        I found some barrel nut adapters on Amazon that we could use to glue onto the balls. These would then connect to any standard 1/4" screw (which most tripods support).

        We also bought:

            - Masking Tape: £1
            - Super Glue: £2
            - Coarse Sandpaper: £2

## Building the Light Probes

### Splitting the Spheres

Many probes you see online are split with one half reflective and one half matte. We decided to do this for our 20cm and 15cm balls, whilst having one fully reflective and one fully matte 10cm ball.

The first step for making the probe is taping off half of the sphere. The covered half is going to be the reflective side, whilst the exposed half is going to be matte.

### The Matte Side

Once the sphere is taped off. Take your sandpaper and begin sanding the exposed side. This is to help the paint stick to the surface of the ball. 

Once you feel that the surface is rough enough, take out your paint and begin spraying the exposed surface. We did 2-3 coats to make sure that everything was covered. Leave the paint to dry and then peel off the tape *(carefully!)*.

We found that the paint would peel off quite easily if scratched, so try and be gentle and store it in a place where it isn't likely to get damaged.

### Attaching the Adapters

When you've finished painting the spheres, you can now attach the adapters! 

First, sand-down on the of the ends of the adapter until the paint is removed. Then, fold some tissue paper and cut a circle that would fit nicely underneath.

Get your superglue and put some on the sanded-end of the nut, then stick the tissue paper on. Add some more superglue and then attach it firmly to your ball.

*The reason we use the paper is that when superglued it turns into a slight paste, helping the adapter stick better.*

## The Finished Probes

It took us about an hour to figure out how to create the probes, but the job could probably be done in about 10 minutes.

## Making Our Lookdev Scene

Another thing that we decided to create was our own custom look-development scene. This scene would be used to check that our assets look realistic enough to fit in the film.

We saw that most lookdev sets online were full 3d scenes. We originally planned to follow in suite but then decided to shoot against a real work backplate and "composite" it in would yield better results (and render faster).

We did the lookdev scene in two parts:

### Interior Lookdev

The Interior Lookdev scene took a full day for us to do. As we hadn't had much experience onset, we spent alot of time making sure that we knew how to use the cameras and lights.

We went through multiple iterations of the lookdev scene, eventually ending on a simple setup at Bournemouth University's PGB sound stage.

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;">
<img src="/public/blog/rebels/diy/inside_lookdev.jpg" style="width: 80%; margin: 1em;"/>
</div>

We measured the scene (cameras, lights, etc.), and took numerous photos of the set under different lighting conditions and multiple camera angles. We also placed some real world objects into the scene to use as reference when doing lookdev.

Once finished, we then took multiple HDRI's to capture the ambient lighting of the sound stage.

### Exterior Lookdev

The Exterior Lookdev was much simpler to create. We setup our camera, measured the scene, took our backplate photos with the grey ball and color checker, and then took an HDRI.

## Using the Lookdev Scene

Once we had captured all the data we needed, We began processing it for the lookdev scene. We very quickly came across two issues.

The first problem had to do with RAW conversions. The Panasonic Lumix S5's took photos in .RW2 format, which could not be natively read by most softwares. 
We tried a few different conversion techniques, all which seemed to bake a color-space into the image (which we didn't want). We ended up using the Adobe DNG converter and then further converting the DNG into EXR using DaVinci Resolve. This provided us with the most accurate color conversion.

The second problem we had was that our background for the interior lookdev scene was too dark. If we exposed to the correct grey ball value, we found the asset would look as if it was floating in a void. If we exposed to where the scene was nicely lit, the asset would blow out.

Although not accurate, we decided to expose up the backplate whilst keeping the asset at the same exposure. This allowed us to have nice looking lookdev scenes, at an expense of a less-accurate lookdev scene.

We also found sensor dirt in the cameras and Felix Wright went through and manually painted them out.

Christopher Hosken then built a Houdini Solaris Tool in which we could lookdev and render our assets for review and publishing.

## Lessons for Next Time

We found creating our own Light Probes and Lookdev Environment extremely useful for understanding the visual effects pipeline. Often we find ourselves primarily working on the computer,
and doing onset practical work has given us a chance to practice skills we dont normally get to pratice.

That said, there are numerous things we would do again when given the chance:

- Have an easy working Color Pipeline and be aware of Color-Space conversions.
- Clean your cameras.
- Make sure to properly light your lookdev scene.
- Give yourself enough time in case something goes wrong.
- Always have real world reference.

Once we did all our setup, we moved onto filming our short film.
