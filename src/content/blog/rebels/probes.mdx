Being a student film, we sadly did not have the budget as a team to buy a £900 light probe kit. 

We instead went for the low budget £60 alternative (£15 per person, 4 balls).

## Light Probe Requirements

The two most important factors for creating accurate light probes are:

1. Accurate, clean reflections

2. 18% reflective matte grey surface

This is best shown on a sphere because:

1. A reflective sphere mimics a fisheye lens, giving you a similar reference to an HDRI.

2. A sphere allows you to see bounce light from *all* directions. Giving you an easy to read reference.

3. Spheres are dead-easy to replicate in CG, making lightmatching simpler.

## Prepping the parts

### The Chrome Sphere

It's extremely diffucult (and costly) to obtain perfectly smooth and reflective spheres. 
We ended up spending £20 on 4 Garden Chrome balls from Amazon.

We then had 4 spheres, a 20cm, 15cm, and 10cm (x2). They were heavier than expected and felt like good quality.

However, the spheres had a seam running around the edge that would warp reflections (However this was barely noticable in our light captures).


### The 18% Grey & More

Originally, our plan was to go to the nearest hardware store and find any gray paint that had a similar 18% reflectance. 
But then we found a can of perfectly 18% grey spray paint on [VFX Store](vfx-store.com) for £20. We decided *"why not?"* and went for it.

One issue that we had with making our own probes was that we didn't have anything to connect it to. 
I found some barrel nut adapters on Amazon that we could use to glue onto the balls. These would then connect to any standard 1/4" screw (which most tripods support).

We also bought:

    - Masking Tape: £1
    - Super Glue: £2
    - Coarse Sandpaper: £2

## Building the Light Probes

### Splitting the Spheres

Many probes you see online are split with one half reflective and one half matte. We decided to do this for our 20cm and 15cm balls, whilst having one fully reflective and one fully matte 10cm ball.

The first step for making the probe is taping off half of the sphere. The covered half is going to be the reflective side, whilst the exposed half is going to be matte.

### The Matte Side

Once the sphere is taped off. Take your sandpaper and begin sanding the exposed side. This is to help the paint stick to the surface of the ball. 

Once you feel that the surface is rough enough, take out your paint and begin spraying the exposed surface. We did 2-3 coats to make sure that everything was covered. Leave the paint to dry and then peel off the tape *(carefully!)*.

We found that the paint would peel off quite easily if scratched, so try and be gentle and store it in a place where it isn't likely to get damaged.


### Attaching the Adapters

When you've finished painting the spheres, you can now attach the adapters! 

First, sand-down on the of the ends of the adapter until the paint is removed. Then, fold some tissue paper and cut a circle that would fit nicely underneath.

Get your superglue and put some on the sanded-end of the nut, then stick the tissue paper on. Add some more superglue and then attach it firmly to your ball.

*The reason we use the paper is that when superglued it turns into a slight paste, helping the adapter stick better.*

## The Finished Probes

It took us about an hour to figure out how to create the probes, but the job could probably be done in about 10 minutes.
