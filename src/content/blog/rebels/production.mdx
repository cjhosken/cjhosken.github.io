## Shooting

We planned to take two days to do our shoot. 
One day for capturing all our footage, the other day for scanning, texture grabbing, and getting reference. 
Due to weather, time, and camera issues we ended up spending both days doing both.

We left Bournemouth at 7:30am to get to Cheddar for 10. We would then film for the whole day (with breaks), and then return back to Bournemouth for 10pm.

We all had our own responibilities onset, although roles were often juggled between us:

- Timothy Courtice | Lead Camera Operator
- Harvey Hamilton | Cinematographer
- Christopher Hosken | Director
- Felix Wright | VFX Supervisor

### Cameras & Kit

For filming we used a Canon Panasonic Lumix S5 on a Gimbal. We had a second S5 for HDRI capture, scans, and BTS photography.

Chris and Harvey also brought their Pentax K500 and 

Alongside that, we took along tripods, a color checker, and our light probes.

The equipment fit all inside of Tim's car which we drove to and from Cheddar Gorge.

### Scanning

We did scanning in the early mornings when the sun hadn't illuminated the gorge, or when the sky was overcast.
We scanned the perimeter of the gorge as well as some of the key elements that the robots would interact with such as the Cave Entrance, Rock Slab, and Rock Bench.

We used a diverse set of cameras to get the scanning done, as we knew we could match the color later on when processing the data.
For some of assets we experimented with using PolyCam. However, we found their quality to be nowhere near to what our cameras captured.

We also measured the areas we scanned. This was extremely important as we wanted our digital scans to match the scale of the real world objects.

We processed our scans using Agisoft metashape pro, which were then converted into USD assets in Houdini.

### Filming

Overall, we ended up shooting 3 versions of the film: morning, cloudy, evening. We then mix and matched to get the best looking edit (that still has consistent lighting!)

The biggest issue we had which we didn't realise until the second day was that both Lumix s5's had a good amount of sensor dirt on them. 
As we rented the equipment from the university we weren't allowed to clean the dirt off the sensor. We ended up removing the sensor dirt in comp.

We had Tim and Harvey operating the camera for the shots. Most shots were on the gimbal, with one being off the gimbal.

Every shot we start with the clapper, color checker, then the light probe. This helped us dial in the correct color settings for each shot. 
The light probe also gave us light reference for intergration. We took multiple HDRI's after shots and throughout the day to get the different lighting conditions.

### The Caves

On the second day we had time to go into the Cheddar Gorge caves, we spent our time photographing the cave walls, cabling, and whatever would be good reference for creating a CG cave.

## REBELS Pipeline

Pipeline was a large challenge early on as we wanted to have a production system that was easy to use and could flow quite nicely. We based our folder structure off Cave Academy's vfx sequence structure and made our own changes where needed.

Chris was in charge of maintaining the pipeline and keeping the plugin tools up to date.

## Machine & Software Specs

As of 2025, the machines at Bournemouth Unviersity had a 12th Gen i9 CPU, 64GB Ram, and an Nvidia RTX 4080. For REBELS we used:

- Houdini 20.5.332
- Maya 2024/2025
- Nuke 15v0.2
- Blender 3.3.0
- Arnold (Htoa)
- Syntheyes
- DaVinci Resolve
- Agisoft MetaShape Pro 2.2
- Substance Painter 11.0+

## Cross Compatibility & Storage

All the machines on campus are dual boot Windows/RHEL9. We wanted to use something that would allow us to share files between the two, and across multiple machines. Our approach to this was to use Microsoft Teams and OneDrive. We found that a singular Teams group could hold up to 25TB data, and we could use shortcuts in OneDrive to directly access this data.

To get this working in linux, Chris designed an rclone setup script that would mount the teams drive into `/home/user/REBELS`. 
He also setup an `$RBL` environment variable for Linux and Windows which could be use for absolute pathing (otherwise a user's username would break absolute paths). However, we tried to stick with using relative pathing where possible.

## USD, Houdini, Arnold

REBELS used a Houdini centric USD pipeline, with rendering in Arnold.

## Color Pipeline
Color pipeline was one of the hardest parts of the entire project.
