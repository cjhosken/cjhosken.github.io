## Getting Started

The idea for REBELS began in late november of 2024. We were sitting in class watching some of the winning short films from Bournemouth, Hertfordshire and ArtFX, and we decided that if wanted to make something of high quality we would have to start prepping as soon as possible.

We originally had 2 different ideas before we decided on REBELS. We all loved sci-fi and wanted to make something that reminded audiences of The Creator or Star Wars, we also saw that REBELS would tick all the boxes for the roles we all wanted to persue.

We then wrote the script and started storyboarding some ideas.


## Location Scouting

Once we had a story, we started thinking about where we wanted to film it. 
We first wanted to film at Winspit Quarry in Dorset, however after seeing that Bournemouth University would never accept the risk assessment form we began looking for other locations.

We settled on Cheddar Gorge for its beautiful landscape and location. We also saw that not many films and shows have used Cheddar Gorge and we wanted to profit off it's uniqueness (Ironically, around that time we heard that filming for [28 Years Later]() was going to take place there).

We visited Cheddar Gorge in January to see if shooting there was doable. We found a perfect location and returned home with enough data to start our pre-vis (and lots of tasty Cheddar cheese!).

## Pre-Visualization

Once we returned, we processed our data and began working on a pre-viz animatic. The animatic helped us decide what sort of lenses we would need, what time of day we should shoot, and what sort of VFX we would need.

## Concept Art

We approached REBELS in a similar way to what Gareth Edwards did with [The Creator]() by doing most of our concept art *after* the shoot. We knew the general shapes and sizes of our subjects decided to jump straight into filming before we began figuring out how our assets would look.

This technique worked amazingly for us as we were able to process our plates and data whilst discussing concepts.

We worked closely with [Gabriel Drummond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-drummond-6b9ba9248), a concept artist friend of ours who was also entering his final year of university at Norwich University of the Arts. Throughout the Summer he created concepts for the all the primary assets, as well as designed the titles and logo for us.

We decided on a mix of WW2 and Diesel Punk. We wanted a nice grimy look that still had a sci-fi feel to it.

We underwent numerous iterations of the robots. We wanted them to be visually unique but could still appeal to the audience. We went with a motif of them having multiple camera lenses for their face.

## Prepping for the Shoot & Reference Gathering

Leading up to the shoot, we started gathering assets and creating tools that we would need either onset or shortly after.

### Making a Light Probe

Being a student film, we sadly did not have the budget as a team to buy a £900 light probe kit. 

We instead went for the low budget £60 alternative (£15 per person, 4 balls).

#### Light Probe Requirements

The two most important factors for creating accurate light probes are:

1. Accurate, clean reflections

2. 18% reflective matte grey surface

This is best shown on a sphere because:

1. A reflective sphere mimics a fisheye lens, giving you a similar reference to an HDRI.

2. A sphere allows you to see bounce light from *all* directions. Giving you an easy to read reference.

3. Spheres are dead-easy to replicate in CG, making lightmatching simpler.

#### The Chrome Sphere

It's extremely diffucult (and costly) to obtain perfectly smooth and reflective spheres. 
We ended up spending £20 on 4 Garden Chrome balls from Amazon.

        It's extremely diffucult (and costly) to obtain perfectly smooth and reflective spheres. 
        We ended up spending £20 on 4 Garden Chrome balls from Amazon.

        We then had 4 spheres, a 20cm, 15cm, and 10cm (x2). They were heavier than expected and felt like good quality.

        However, the spheres had a seam running around the edge that would warp reflections (However this was barely noticable in our light captures)

#### The 18% Grey & More

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;">

    <img src="/public/blog/rebels/preproduction/paint.jpg" style="height: 400px; object-fit: contain;"/>

    <div style="width:90%; margin:1em;">

        Originally, our plan was to go to the nearest hardware store and find any gray paint that had a similar 18% reflectance. 
        But then we found a can of perfectly 18% grey spray paint on [VFX Store](vfx-store.com) for £20. We decided *"why not?"* and went for it.

        One issue that we had with making our own probes was that we didn't have anything to connect it to. 
        I found some barrel nut adapters on Amazon that we could use to glue onto the balls. These would then connect to any standard 1/4" screw (which most tripods support).

        We also bought:

            - Masking Tape: £1
            - Super Glue: £2
            - Coarse Sandpaper: £2

    </div>

#### Splitting the Spheres

Many probes you see online are split with one half reflective and one half matte. We decided to do this for our 20cm and 15cm balls, whilst having one fully reflective and one fully matte 10cm ball.

The first step for making the probe is taping off half of the sphere. The covered half is going to be the reflective side, whilst the exposed half is going to be matte.

</div>

#### The Matte Side

Once the sphere is taped off. Take your sandpaper and begin sanding the exposed side. This is to help the paint stick to the surface of the ball. 

Once you feel that the surface is rough enough, take out your paint and begin spraying the exposed surface. We did 2-3 coats to make sure that everything was covered. Leave the paint to dry and then peel off the tape *(carefully!)*.

We found that the paint would peel off quite easily if scratched, so try and be gentle and store it in a place where it isn't likely to get damaged.

</div>

#### Attaching the Adapters

When you've finished painting the spheres, you can now attach the adapters! 

First, sand-down on the of the ends of the adapter until the paint is removed. Then, fold some tissue paper and cut a circle that would fit nicely underneath.

Get your superglue and put some on the sanded-end of the nut, then stick the tissue paper on. Add some more superglue and then attach it firmly to your ball.

*The reason we use the paper is that when superglued it turns into a slight paste, helping the adapter stick better.*

#### The Finished Probes

It took us about an hour to figure out how to create the probes, but the job could probably be done in about 10 minutes.

### Making Our Lookdev Scene

Another thing that we decided to create was our own custom look-development scene. This scene would be used to check that our assets look realistic enough to fit in the film.

We saw that most lookdev sets online were full 3d scenes. We originally planned to follow in suite but then decided to shoot against a real work backplate and "composite" it in would yield better results (and render faster).

We did the lookdev scene in two parts:

#### Interior Lookdev

The Interior Lookdev scene took a full day for us to do. As we hadn't had much experience onset, we spent alot of time making sure that we knew how to use the cameras and lights.

We went through multiple iterations of the lookdev scene, eventually ending on a simple setup at Bournemouth University's PGB sound stage.

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;">
<img src="/public/blog/rebels/preproduction/inside_lookdev.jpg" style="width: 80%; margin: 1em;"/>
</div>

We measured the scene (cameras, lights, etc.), and took numerous photos of the set under different lighting conditions and multiple camera angles. We also placed some real world objects into the scene to use as reference when doing lookdev.

Once finished, we then took multiple HDRI's to capture the ambient lighting of the sound stage.

#### Exterior Lookdev

The Exterior Lookdev was much simpler to create. We setup our camera, measured the scene, took our backplate photos with the grey ball and color checker, and then took an HDRI.

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;">
<img src="/public/blog/rebels/preproduction/outside_lookdev.jpg" style="width: 80%; margin: 1em;"/>
</div>

#### Using the Lookdev Scene

Once we had captured all the data we needed, We began processing it for the lookdev scene. We very quickly came across two issues.

The first problem had to do with RAW conversions. The Panasonic Lumix S5's took photos in .RW2 format, which could not be natively read by most softwares. 
We tried a few different conversion techniques, all which seemed to bake a color-space into the image (which we didn't want). We ended up using the Adobe DNG converter and then further converting the DNG into EXR using DaVinci Resolve. This provided us with the most accurate color conversion.

The second problem we had was that our background for the interior lookdev scene was too dark. If we exposed to the correct grey ball value, we found the asset would look as if it was floating in a void. If we exposed to where the scene was nicely lit, the asset would blow out.

Although not accurate, we decided to expose up the backplate whilst keeping the asset at the same exposure. This allowed us to have nice looking lookdev scenes, at an expense of a less-accurate lookdev scene.

We also found sensor dirt in the cameras and Felix Wright went through and manually painted them out.

Chris then built a Houdini Solaris Tool in which we could lookdev and render our assets for review and publishing.

### Bournemouth Aviation Museum

We also visited the Bournemouth Aviation Museum to gather nice metal reference as well as other bits and bobs. Being able to sit in old planes gave us a feel for the mood of our assets and refine the concepts that Gabe was providing us with (It was also lots of fun).
