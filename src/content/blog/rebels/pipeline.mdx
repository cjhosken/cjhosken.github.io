## Introduction

Quite early into production, our team wanted a pipeline to manage our assets and shots. 
We based our folder structure off of the [Cave Academy VFX Structure](), with a few changes for workspaces.

I (Chris) was in charge of maintaining the pipeline and keeping the plugin tools up to date.

## Machine & Software Specs

As of 2025, the machines at Bournemouth Unviersity had a 12th Gen i9 CPU, 64GB Ram, and an Nvidia RTX 4080. For REBELS we used:

- Houdini 20.5.332
- Maya 2024/2025
- Nuke 15v2.4
- Blender 3.3.0/5.0.0
- Syntheyes
- DaVinci Resolve
- Agisoft MetaShape Pro 2.2
- Substance Painter 11.0+

Luckily, as our pipeline was USD based, we didn't have to worry *too* much about software version mismatches.

## Cross Compatibility & Storage

All the machines at Bournemouth are dual boot Windows 11 / RHEL 9. We wanted to be able to easily access and share our files between the two, and across multiple machines. 
Our approach to this was to use Microsoft Teams and OneDrive. We found that a singular Teams group could store 25TB data, and we could directly shortcut the teams folder into OneDrive for directly access in the file browser.
This meant that we could launch Houdini (for example), and it would load all nessacary files on demand whilst we worked. Leading to a heavily streamlined workflow.

To get this working in Linux, I also designed an rclone setup script that would mount the teams drive into `/home/user/REBELS`. 

I also setup a `$RBL` environment variable for Linux and Windows which could be use for absolute pathing (otherwise a user's username would break absolute paths). However, we tried to stick with using relative pathing where possible.

## USD, Houdini, Solaris

We quickly agreed on using a Houdini centric USD pipeline for production. It was incredibly successful in previous group projects and we didn't want to deal with the fuss of Maya projects.

Our rendering was done in Solaris, which meant that we could switch to any renderer we felt like. 
However we stuck with Karma because it was one of the fastest renderers available to us (It also meant we could use the renderfarm).

## Color Pipeline
We struggled alot early on with our color pipeline, however towards the middle part of production we started to understand how things worked.

All our renders were done in ACEScg, we had a custom OCIO config that was shared between all our DCCs. We then comped out as Linear in Nuke, with our own DaVinci Resolve color transform applied on top.

## Custom Tools & The NCCA Renderfarm

I also developed numerous Houdini tools for Asset Building, Lookdev, Rendering, and the incredibly successful NCCA Renderfarm Tool.

### The NCCA Renderfarm

The NCCA Renderfarm has been known to be unusable by students at Bournemouth. Mostly abandoned, it was only configured to work with rendering in Houdini.

The farm featured a convoluted submission setup, in which most previously written tools were depricated. 
I spent a couple weeks developing a Houdini Solaris node that would package projects into a single folder, submit it to the farm, and then render them as a farm job.

This tool dramatically sped up our renders and we didn't have to worry much about long render times for shots.
