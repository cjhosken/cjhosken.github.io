# Introduction

*"In the midst of a revolution against an oppressive government. A band of robots discover a powerful crystal that may overturn the course of the war."* 

*REBELS* was our final year project (FMP) at Bournemouth University. 
It was the cumilation of my (and my team's) 3 years of studies, and we wanted to make an epic sci-fi short inspired by the work of Industrial Light and Magic and Gareth Edwards.

# The Team

Our team consisted of [Christopher Hosken](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-hosken/) (Me) as Tech Lead and Generalist TD, [Harvey Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harvey-hamilton-783bb42a0/) as Animation Lead and CG Generalist, [Felix Wright](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-wright-7135542a1/) as Compositing Lead and VFX Generalist, and [Timothy Courtice](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-courtice-b56837295) as Asset Lead and VFX Generalist.

Together, we juggled the roles of Directing, Producing, Asset Creation, Animation, FX, Lighting, Compositing, Onset Supervision, and more to bring REBELS to life.
