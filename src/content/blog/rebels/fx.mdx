REBELS features a few primary simulations, mostly explosions. These were done by Me (Chris).

## Cliff Explosions

## Rock Fall
The rock fall inside the cave was done with custom fracturing and animated activation. The actual rock smaash was done by Harvey.

Felix was responsible for the sparks simulation at the start of the film.
