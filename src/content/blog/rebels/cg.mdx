# Introduction
Harvey led production on most of the CG scenes.


# Rendering
For rendering, we used Houdini Solaris with Karma. It was incredibly quick for most shots (especially on the renderfarm), however we had alot of crashes with subdivision (alot of shot-based subdividing was done).

Chris developed a "REBELS Render Settings" node that would configure all the sampling, AOVs and LPEs needed for rendering.
