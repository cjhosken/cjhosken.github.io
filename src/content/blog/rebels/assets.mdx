# Introduction

Timothy Courtice was the lead asset artist for REBELS. He primarily focused on the hero assets such as the Robots and Blimp, 
however he also directed us on how to optimise our assets, correctly UV and create realistic textures. This page goes over his process on how assets were created.

## Robots
My main task in this project was to create the robots, from the side characters to the main hero (Luke). To start with however, we needed some concepts and we thankfully got help from a concept artist friend of mine, Gabriel Drummond.
Gabe helped us massively on this project, allowing us envision our desired aesthetic without the main crew deviating from their main roles to create the concepts.

If you want to look more at the concepts you can check out our [Pre-Production](/blog/rebels/preproduction) page.

### Modelling
I did the modelling in Maya and I started by blocking out the general shapes to see how much we could deviate from the concept.
Gabe's concepts were great but some elements were not feasible for the mechanical elements and rig so I had to make some adjustments to the design. 

Once I had a blockout which had enough mobility that we were happy with, I proceeded to make the forms more final and aesthetically pleasing. 
I reworked a few shapes from the concept so they followed a more consistent shape language.
In our initial animatic we had closeups of the head and feet so these were the elements I tackled first to ensure we were happy with the design before moving onto details.

Once I had a model that had all the elements I could hand off a version to Chris for him to start rigging in APEX.
During this stage, Chris and I conversed a lot, making ammendments to the model where necessary to get the rig to work properly.
Around half way through this process we found a problem with the model that was very detremental.
The hip joint was not aligned in the same plane as the knee and ankle so the IK chain kept on breaking as it could not solve the rest position.
Thus I needed to remodel the hips to align the ball joint to the other joints and after that the problem was fixed.
