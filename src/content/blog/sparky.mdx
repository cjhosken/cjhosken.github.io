# Introduction
Sparky (2020) is a short film that I was given the opportunity to write and help produce. The short film is about a WALL-E-inspired robot, Sparky, whose purpose is to save the environment in his city, Glenton.

I wrote the script, helped with storyboarding, and led a small team to take Sparky from concept to completion. I also took on modelling, texturing, animation, FX, lighting and rendering roles.

## BOAP
The Blender Open Animation Project was origanised by a small team of Blender enthusiasts. Over the course of 16 months, 32 of us worked together online to complete a short film. Many of us varied in skill and experience, and this project was many of our first time working in a large team.

## Pre-Production
I wrote Sparky whilst the project was beginning to start up and pitched it to the team. The director and producer were on board with the idea and gave me a supervisor position for overseeing the project.


## Production
We began production on the 26th of July, we listed job postings online and accepted anyone who met a minimum talent threshold. As the project was volunteer based we didn't have much control over when people could work, so we were very lenient with delegation which caused numerous delays.

Many of our artists had their own artistic vision that did not fit into the project scope, and I had to deal with alot of conflict management and a couple cases of plagiarism.

### Modelling & Texturing
We wanted all the models in the short to be our own (except for Gleb Alexandrov's ducky), so alot of time was spent on modelling and texturing.

I helped mockup the original design for Sparky, and textured him using Substance Painter. I used a Blender plugin for generating the people, and rigged them using Rigify.

I also modelled a few of the environments, such as the warehouse.

### Animation
The hardest part with animation was getting the characters to not look too uncanny. Rigify didn't give us all the controls we wanted, and skinning issues caused more problems throughout our production.

A couple of our artists made some fun animations for social media.

I was personally responsible for animated a few shots. One of my favourite being the wind turbine scene.

Many of our shots had to be reworked, and towards the end of production many of our artists had stopped being active in the team chat. The director had to go through at the end and get all the shots finished. For rendering we used Sheep-IT render farm and our personal computers. We found this the quickest and most reliable way to render the short.

We got in contact with a music producer who wrote an original score for us, and then our director edited the film.

## Release
Sparky was released on September 27, 2020 to Youtube.
