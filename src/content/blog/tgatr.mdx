# Introduction

*The Girl and the Robot* was a live action short film that I made with [Bethany Prince](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bethany-prince-a68429342/?trk=blended-typeahead) in our last year of High School. I was in charge of directing and visual effects, and she was responsible for producing.

## Pre-Production

We began by writing the script and designing the storyboard. I also did some concepts for the robot.

## Production

Once we were happy with the story, we jumped into production. Bethany was in charge of hiring cast and location scouting, I began working on the robot asset. I made the asset in Blender and textured it in substance with UDIMs.

Once we got some actors, we began shooting the short film. Below is a bts shot of one of the scenes.

## VFX

Once filming was complete, I began tracking the footage and integrating the Robot into the shots.

## Editing & Release

We then edited the film and released it on April 4th, 2023; just over a year after the start of production.
